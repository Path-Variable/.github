## Path Variable

Path Variable was founded in April of 2021 by Ivan Šarić when he decided to stop working as a salaried employee
and develop software as an external contractor. 

The company is primarly a vehicle to allow the formation of work contracts with entities headquartered oustide
the Republic of Croatia. 

A secondory purpose for the organisation is to host and serve educational content writen by the founder in his
spare time.

Fun fact - the author subsits on a diet of body building supplements, rigorous physical training and constant
self-improvement. He takes more pills in one day than an average person takes in a year. This last part is made
up but I might try to back it up with stats one day. :)

The main portfolio sight for the company is [here](https://www.path-variable.com).
A blog exists at [this address](https://blog.path-variable.com) where you can check out my how-to articles, talks and discussions.
